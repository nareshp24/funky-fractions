creating a fraction f = 2/5
f =  2/5
creating a fraction g = 2/4
g =  2/4
creating a fraction h = 2/4 in reduced form by setting the "reduced" argument
h =  1/2

performing arithmetic operations on f and g
f + g =  9/10
f - g =  -1/10
f * g =  1/5
f / g =  4/5

performing comparison with f, g and h
f < g:  True
f > g:  False
f <= g:  True
f >= g:  False
f == g:  False
f != g:  True
h == g:  True

f =  2/5  is a proper fraction:  True
j =  5/2  is an improper fraction:  True

numerator of f:  2
denominator of f:  5
reciprocal of f:  5/2

k =  4/6 reduced form of k =  2/3
decimal equivalent of (f - g) =  -0.1

creating fraction from string input m = Fraction.from_string(6/8)
m =  6/8

printing 1st 10 multiples of f =  2/5
[2/5, 4/5, 6/5, 8/5, 2, 12/5, 14/5, 16/5, 18/5, 4]

printing the multiples of f =  2/5 from 5th to 10th multiple
[2, 12/5, 14/5, 16/5, 18/5, 4]

Hurray! Everything works just fine
