### Fraction class implementation in python 3

The docstrings and comments present in the class implementation give info regarding the methods defined.

### Some important things
1. The input to create an object of Fraction type should be an 'int' or 'str' that can be converted to 'int' (gives an error otherwise)
2. The denominator can never be zero
3. Negative fractions are represented by negative numerators (if the denominator is negative, the negative sign transferred to numerator)
4. If the denominator is 1, only the numerator is printed (although the denominator is preserved internally)
